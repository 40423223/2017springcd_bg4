<h2>以下為翻譯</h2>

i'm really excited about the new graphics 
that are comming out in hyper mentionthis release

我真的很興奮的介紹新圖形出現的這個版本

we went back to the drawing board on graphics 

我們看到這個繪圖板上的圖形

now we're really urilizing the full capabilities of the graphics cards  on any system 

現在我們能在任何系統上用到顯卡全部功能

really and the new system has much better quality graphics 

真的和新系統有更好的質量圖形

and we have features now like as you zoom close into your model the mesh lines appear 

像我們現在的功能就是當你靠近放大模型就會有內部格線出現

but as you zoom out rather than getting a black model 

而當你縮小不再是一個黑色模型

the mesh lines fade and now you're actually selecting and working at a hard level rather than an element leve 

內部格線會漸漸消失，但你現在實際上是選擇工作水平，而不是一個元素水平

and even more exciting as the performance of the graphics 

甚至更令人興奮的是圖形的性能

so with the really large models are seeing buge performance boosts with the new graphics

能隨著真的大模型看到buge的性能提升與新的圖形

so we have one model at 8.5 million elements that we use for benchmarks metmodels running 15 times faster 

所以我們有一個模型在850萬畫素，我用基準motmodel 運行15倍更快顯示

display rapin than previously in 13 

rapi比在13

and geometry is even faster still getting as much of the 60 times performance boost 

幾何體甚至更快地獲得60倍的性能提升
