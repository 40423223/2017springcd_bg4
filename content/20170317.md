<h2>以下為翻譯</h2>

we've also introduced what is called the park 

我們還去可以使用公共模型

empathy now and i promise just like CAD park entity 

就像CAD模型一樣

so what that allows us to do is give you theexact same billof materials 

模型中我們給你完全一樣的物料清單

in the hypermesh models that you have in your cad systems 

讓你在你的CAD系統中使用

what we can do now is have say like thin solid it normally since 15 on many differentcomponents

我們還可以做出，像較薄的物件通常有15種不同的性質

but our shell components and you still want to group all those components into playing withparts and mangement completion away 

並且將這些所有物質分配組到使用零件的一部分

 if you want another representation which may be has a differentmesh density you can do that and configure your model according to different types of disciplines or crash or mph you

所以如果你想要不同性質表示不同密度，你可以做到並根據不同需求來配置你的模型

one of the biggest new capabilities and hyper works for tino is our new modeling and assembly capabilities in hypermesh

最大新功能是我們的新建模和組和能力 

most people that manufacture products have many different

許多產品製造有許多不同的配裝 

configurationsof those products and they want to keep their CAE models very much in sync 
with the CAM and PLM system 

它們希望能與他們的CAE模型與CAM和PLM系統同步

so now we've introduced into hypermesh the ability  to synchronize directly to the PDM 

所以現在我們介紹了hypermesh能夠直接同步到PDM

system can actually import those materials with multiple configurations of the model

系統實際上可以導入那些具有多種配置的材料模型 

so now the hypermesh model has all those configuratinons in it each part in a 
hypermesh model

現在hypermesh模型有每個部份的配置
 
can now have multiple versions and by just reconfiguring your model you can match 
the configurations that you normally deal with cad model 

所以現在你可以有很多個模型選擇匹配
